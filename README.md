Chat Application
===============

eXo Chat is an Instant Messaging application for eXo Platform 4.
Thanks to [Weemo](http://www.weemo.com) and their powerful cloud solution, itâ€™s even possible to benefit from Video Conferencing (One to One, Conference) and Screen Sharing from within eXo Chat.

You can discuss or find help on [eXo Chat Space Community](http://community.exoplatform.com/portal/g/:spaces:chat_application/chat_application)

Technically speaking, this Chat application comes with a client project (/application) and a server project (/server). All the Chat data is stored using MongoDB for storage.
Server can run on the same Java Application Server but as it's a near to real time application and can process a lot of data, it's recommended to use the Chat Server as a standalone application on another AS.
Thus, Chat Client portlets will run on an eXo Platform based App Server, where the Chat Server can run on a standard tomcat installation.

I wrote some blog posts on this app and technologies I use to build it, you can find them here :

If you simply want to build it and use it, follow the steps.

Roadmap is available in the wiki section : [Chat Roadmap](https://github.com/exo-addons/chat-application/wiki/Roadmap)

Be Up and Running
===============

One Tomcat Server mode
----------------------

Jump to Wiki Install Page : [One Server Mode](https://github.com/exo-addons/chat-application/wiki/One-Server-Mode)

Two Tomcat Servers mode
-----------------------

To be sure, the Chat will never interfere with eXo Platform, you can install it on a separated server. It's of course the recommended configuration.

Jump to Wiki Install Page : [Two Servers Mode](https://github.com/exo-addons/chat-application/wiki/Two-Servers-Mode)

Migrate to Chat 1.2
-------------------
* Before processing the migration, it's recommended to backup the data. This can be done with the following command:

	mongodump --host {host} --port {port} --username {username} --password {password} --db {dbName} --out "{backup_folder}"

with {host} and {port} are respectively hostname/IP and port of mongoDB server; {username} and {password} are required if authentication is enabled for your database; {dbName} is name of chat database and {backup_folder} is path to folder that backup data is stored.

* To migrate, you have two options:

** Automatical migration: you just need to turn off your Chat Server, deploy new chatServer.war package then restart Chat Server.

** Manual migration: to do a manual migration, you have to get the migration script - migration-chat-addon.js file - that is packaged in chatServer.war/WEB-INF/lib/server-{version}.jar. Extract binary packages to get migration script then launch the following command:

	mongo --quiet {host}:{port}/{dbName} -u {username} -p {password} migration-chat-addon.js

with {host} and {port} are respectively hostname/IP and port of mongoDB server; {username} and {password} are required if authentication is enabled for your database; {dbName} is name of database that is configured in chat.properties.

Testing with Docker
===============

prerequisite : you need Docker 1.10+ and Docker Compose 1.6+

You can use Docker to develop and test eXo Chat add-on in an easy way.
We provide a fully functional Docker Compose file to start eXo Trial with a persistent volume (to keep data across test sessions).

Create a Docker volume
-------------------
This step is only needed once.

    docker volume create --name plf_chat_test

Build the project
-------------------
From the home of the source project :

    # To build everything
    mvn clean package

    # To only build the add-on package and his required modules
    mvn -am -pl :embedded-packaging clean package

(!) you need to execute this step each time you changed the add-on source code and want to redeploy it.

Start eXo Platform
-------------------

Simply use docker-compose to start eXo Trial and the chat add-on

    docker-compose up -d

(!) you need to wait eXo Platform to be started and if you want to tail the eXo Platform logs just do in another terminal :

    docker exec exo_chat tail -f /var/log/exo/platform.log

When you see the `Server startup in xxxxxxx ms` in your logs, it mean that you can use your eXo Platform :

* Linux host : http://localhost/
* from a Windows or OS X host : http://DOCKER_MACHINE_IP/

Code, test & debug the add-on
-------------------

### rebuild and reload your add-on

You have made some changes on the add-on code and you want to test it without restarting eXo Platform ? quite simple ...

What you have to do is :

    # rebuild your add-on package
    mvn -am -pl :embedded-packaging clean package

    # use the add-on manager to redeploy the newly build version
    docker exec exo_chat /opt/exo/current/addon install --catalog=file:///etc/exo/catalog.json  exo-chat:1.3.x-SNAPSHOT --force --batch-mode

WARNING: this will produce a `java.lang.IllegalStateException: No pre init tasks can be added to the portal container ...` exception because eXo doesn't support the full hot reloading of an extension but the 3 wars of the add-ons will still be reloaded.
If you dislike this, you can simply restart the container with `docker-compose restart exo` and wait eXo Platform start ... ;-)

### inspect mongodb data

If you need to connect to the mongodb backend you just need to use the Mongo Shell from the container :

    docker exec -ti exo_chat mongo chat
